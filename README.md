# split_quaternion
Split Quaternion package, originally based upon the Quaternionic library.

Split quaternions are a 4-dimensional algebra, where each element $q\in\mathbb{S}$ is written in the form
$$\text{q} = q_0 + q_1 i + q_2 j + q_3 k$$



(DISCLAIMER: THIS PACKAGE IS UNDERCONSTRUCTION. Hopefully one day I will find the time to package it properly and add documentations )
