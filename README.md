# split_quaternion
Split Quaternion package, originally based upon the Quaternionic library.

Split quaternions are a 4-dimensional associative and non-commutative algebra, where each element $q\in\mathbb{S}$ is written in the form
$$\text{q} = q_0 + q_1 i + q_2 j + q_3 k$$.

The rule of the algebra can be resumed by the formula
$$-i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = (ij)k = 1 $$
